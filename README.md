# Collaborative Modeling Workshop Preparation Canvases
The “Collaborative Modeling Workshop Preparation Canvases” are designed to support facilitators when preparing for collaborative modelling (CoMo) workshops. The goal is to improve the overall quality and outcomes of CoMo workshops and to help newcomers to get started.

The canvases are structured into two main areas:
* Drafting the workshop (Scoping, Planning & Design)
* Personal preparation (People, Methods)

> *NOTE* This is a work in progress. Currently, we've provided the canvas as an image that you can copy and paste into your preferred tool.

> We plan to create an official template on Miro in the future. Additionally, you'll be able to extend the canvas yourself in tools like Notion. If you do so, we'd love to see your contributions! Please remember to give credit, as the canvas is licensed under [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## 1\. Who are the canvases for?

The canvases are designed to support everyone facilitating collaborative modelling workshops. However it might provide different value depending on your experience and the the type of workshop:

**Guidance for New Facilitators:** The canvases offer a structured starting point, helping new facilitators understand how to plan and execute a successful workshop. They outline essential considerations when drafting a workshop and help to avoid common pitfalls.

**Tool for Experienced Facilitators:** Seasoned facilitators can use the canvases as checklists to ensure nothing is overlooked in the preparation process, maintaining high-quality standards. The structured approach also promotes a less biased preparation as one is less influenced by recent experiences and can engage with each workshop anew.

Furthermore, they can be used for the following:

**Exploring New Perspectives:** By highlighting potential different aspects, the canvases encourage facilitators to explore new perspectives and reflect on their own facilitation style. It can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify potentially challenging workshop environments and find blind spots in deceptively easy settings. Certain patterns or triggers during the canvas completion process may indicate complexity or difficulties.

**Preparing for Challenging Environments:**
The canvas is designed to help you when facing rather challenging settings. It will guide you through in your preparation and help you to better understand the environment (goal, status quo & people). It will also support you to make your own assumptions transparent to be able to challenge them. By going through the different sections and related questions, the canvas helps you to effectively prepare the workshop’s outline (storyline, communication strategy, shared goal).

## 2\. Overall Structure

### 2.1 Drafting the Workshop
These canvases are designed to guide you in drafting a workshop, whether it's with your team, facilitating it for colleagues within your company, or for clients if you're a consultant. The information you gather using these canvases should first be discussed with the initiator(s). This discussion should then lead to an invitation of the session where all relevant information is shared with all stakeholders, helping to shape the workshop's goals and structure. The canvases include guiding questions for scoping, planning, and designing a CoMo workshop.

#### [2.1.1 Scoping](#3-scoping)
![Scoping Canvas](resources/scoping.jpg)
#### [2.1.2 Workshop Planning & Design](#4-workshop-planning--design)
![Workshop Planning & Design](resources/workshop-planning-and-design.jpg)

### 2.2 Personal Preparation (**Work in Progress**)
These Canvases serve for your own preparation and should stay **with the facilitators (and their close collaborators) only** as they contain hidden agendas, assumptions, personal triggers, alternatives on methods, thoughts behind the storyline, and more. They target the rather invisible aspects that are crucial for a successful workshop preparation are split into **People** and **Methods**. The people canvas is designed to create awareness on motivations and hidden agendas of your stakeholders and how knowledge and power are distributed. The methods canvas contains different sections that help in designing a consistent storyline throught the workshop and to deep dive on the methods used.

## 3\. Drafting the Workshop - Scoping

Usually the first step when preparing a (collaborative modelling) workshop is discussing its motivation and backgroud (like *what led to the workshop*) as well as the definition of success (like *what should have changed afterwards*). Furthermore, it helps to establish a suitable (working) title early on, discuss initial ideas for the workshop format, and identify the key parties involved (initiator, beneficiaries & potential participants).

### 3.1 Title of Workshop
A clear, concise name for the upcoming collaborative modeling session. 
    
**Why it matters:**  
This title sets expectations and gives the workshop a clear identity from the outset and should be aligned with the goal and scope of the workshop. If you struggle in finding a concise title for the workshop, the goal and scope might not be clear enough yet. Same applies if the title is not understood by stakeholders without further explanation. 

**Examples:**
- “EventStorming Workshop: Improving the Order Fulfillment Process”
- "Re-Discovery Workshop for the Booking Platform"
- "Domain modelling to realign teams"
- "Aligning architecture with a Bytesized Architecture session"

### 3.2 Motivation
This section delves into the "why" behind the workshop. Consider answering the following questions to clarify its purpose:
- What prompted this workshop? What specific situation or challenge led to its initiation?
- What's the current situation or status quo? Describe the existing conditions, systems, or processes.
- How are we/they organized? Outline the team structure, departmental setup, or relevant organizational aspects.
- What does the current architecture look like? Provide an overview of the existing technical or operational architecture.
- What's the current level of DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and CoMo knowledge within the team/organization?
- What specific problems are we trying to solve or opportunities are we trying to capture?

**Why it matters:**  
It is important that you are clear about the problem you want to solve and the situation your in. Try not to solve too many problems at the same time and pinpoint the challenge you want to tackle in this workshop. The more you know in advance the better you can adapt the workshop format to the needs of the Initiator & beneficiaries. 
  
What's more, getting stakeholders involved in these initial chats can sometimes be super valuable. If you can organise some interviews with some of the stakeholders defined after the initial scoping to improve the motivation. It helps them grasp the problem more fully and deepen their understanding, which is already a huge step toward finding a solution or making things better.
  
**Examples:**
- To identify process bottlenecks in our current order-to-delivery workflow and collaboratively propose improvements. 
- Currently, our average delivery time has increased from 2 days to 5 days in the last quarter.  
- Customer complaints have risen by 40%.  
- Multiple departments (Sales, Warehouse, Shipping) have overlapping responsibilities but lack clear communication.

### 3.3 Definition of Success
Think about what the workshop should achieve—what needs to change or improve. What are the core goals that absolutely must be met by the end of the session? Make sure to frame these as a win-win opportunity for everyone involved. You can also include some objectives that would be great to hit but aren't strictly mandatory.

**Why it matters:**  
A definition of success for a workshop is crucial because it clarifies the objectives, outlining what the workshop aims to achieve. It guides the planning process, helping to design the format and activities to meet specific goals. It also provides a way to measure progress and evaluate the workshop's effectiveness. Ultimately, having a clear definition of success enhances focus, keeping discussions and activities centered on achieving the desired results.
  
It aligns participants by ensuring everyone understands the purpose and expected outcomes, providing a baseline so all enter the workshop on the same page. This should be shared beforehand and at the start of the workshop. Being aware of participants' potential fears and motivations is also beneficial (see more in section [5.3 Individual goals, benefits and motivation, (Potential) fears, hidden agendas & politics](#53-individual-goals-benefits-and-motivation-potential-fears-hidden-agendas--politics)).

**Examples:**
- A shared understanding of the “Order Fulfillment” domain and key events and a clear way forward.  
- A prioritized list of bottlenecks and possible interventions.  
- Agreement on next steps to pilot one key improvement.
- A shared understanding between the different departments and everyone pulling in the same direction.

### 3.4 Workshop Format: Initial Ideas
At this stage, there's no need for a concrete agenda. However, it's helpful to start shaping the rough outline of your workshop's format. Think about key elements like the rough time frame, whether that's 1-2 hours, a half-day, or multiple days (1, 2, or even 5 days). You should also consider your initial ideas for methods you might use, such as EventStorming, Domain Storytelling, Context Mapping, User Story Mapping, or Example Mapping.

**Why it matters:**  
Discussing initial ideas on the workshop format early on is important because it shapes the planning process, ensuring the workshop is structured effectively from the start. It aligns expectations among stakeholders, providing a shared understanding of how the workshop will proceed. It helps to identify the necessary resources and to anticipate and address potential challenges.

**Examples:**
- 1-2 hours of Design Level EventStormiung
- 1/2 day with Domain Storytelling and Example Mapping
- 5 days with Wardley Mapping, Big Picture EventStorming, Impact Mapping and Bytesized Architecture sessions.

### 3.5 Initiator & Beneficiaries
Initiator is the person or group who first brought up the idea or identified the need for the workshop. They're the ones who got the ball rolling. Beneficiaries refers to the group or individuals who will directly benefit from the workshop's successful outcome. They're the ones who stand to gain from the changes or improvements the workshop aims to achieve.    

**Why it matters:**  
Understanding who brought the workshop to life helps clarify motivations and possible goals. They often provide valuable background information to the status quo and the people involved. They are your lever into the company / department / team, but they might also have their hidden agenda in doing so. Also be clear about who are your beneficiaries, like who actually benefits in the end of the workshop and it's results. Try to find out as much as possible about the beneficiaries throughout the preparation, e.g. fears and individual motivations. But also be aware they might be wrong / it's just one opinion. You can use the Setting the Stage sessions to get more insights yourself.

**Examples:**
- Initiator: Head of Supply Chain Innovation at XYZ Company & Beneficiaries: Operations and Sales Teams
- Initiator: Senior Dev in Team XYZ Beneficiaries: Dev & Product Teams

### 3.6 Potential Participants 
Everyone who might be needed for the workshop (e.g. Tech Leads, Developers, Tester, Sales Department, Product Owner, User, Customer, Operations, ...).
    
**Why it matters:**  
Thinking through who should be in the room for a collaborative modeling session is absolutely essential. Every person, from Developers to Testers, and from Product Owners, Users to Domain Experts, and especially people who can decide brings a unique and vital perspective. Including these diverse viewpoints isn't just about ticking boxes; it's about building a holistic and accurate understanding of the problem or system you're modeling. When everyone contributes, you not only uncover hidden insights and potential pitfalls early but also foster a shared understanding and stronger buy-in, ultimately leading to more robust solutions and successful outcomes.

**Examples:**
- Software developers
- Testers
- Product Managers
- User researchers
- Business Analists
- Agile Coaches
- Managers
- Users
- Ops Engineers
- .. and all the roles involved and invented in your company in building the software

## 4\. Drafting the Workshop - Workshop Planning & Design

When actually planning and designing the workshop it probably helps to further refine and extend the already gathered information of the Scoping Canvas (in case it was used before, else check out [3. Drafting the Workshop - Scoping](#3-drafting-the-workshop---scoping)). Aditionally there is more information that should be considered which are part of the Workshop Planning & Design Canvas. It also contains optional fields that can be added depending on the format, context and experience of the facilitator(s). The goal is to have all information ready that you need to share with the workshop participants and stakeholders in advance. It should also contain everything you might need to actually design the workshop (e.g. with the [6. Personal Preparation - Methods Canvas](#6-personal-preparation---methods-wip)). 

This canvas contains "default" as well as "optional" fields. The default fields can be considered a recommendation that should fit every workshop setting but can, of course, be adapted depending on the scope and requirements of the workshop. The optional fields contain an (incomplete) list of possible additions and deep dives that might bring useful insights depending on the situation.

### 4.1 Scope of the Workshop
Understanding what falls within and outside the scope is essential. This includes considering products, domains, value streams, teams, services, and systems. Reflect on whether decisions need to be made and consider incorporating decision-making styles (see optional field). Additionally, it may be the right moment to discuss the flight level, such as whether you want to focus on the domain, business processes, application flow or actual code (consider adding the optional field for deeper exploration). Being as specific as possible helps minimize misunderstandings and unexpected surprises. 

**Why it matters:**  
Addressing the scope of the workshop beforehand helps to better understand the problem and determine whom you need for your workshop to be successful. It sets expections and enables the participants to prepare respectively. Being aware of what is in and out of scope helps to keep the workshop focused and that discussions remain productive. Sometimes it is easier to pinpoint what is out of scope than in scope. By asking for both, you can more easily sense and react to any resistnace or conflict in the group and adapt to your stakeholder group and open up new perspectives.

It also helps find the right methods for the workshop and manage expectations (e.g., what is possible vs. what would be wished for in an ideal world). It helps facilitators prioritize if time is limited. If time remains, you can address these. Sometimes it's easier for stakeholders to deprioritize their expectations rather than skip them completely. They can also serve as potential follow-ups after the workshop. 

**Example:**
- Order submission (Sales & Operation Departments) - Strategic Alignment
- Inventory checks - Software Design level 
- Payment processing is out of scope as it is handled separately by Finance
- Customer support ticketing are out of scope as it is handled by Customer Service after delivery
- Provide a decisions-making basis for the leadership team
- Decide on a migraton strategy
- Identify the Re-Discovery Scope for the legacy migration
- We're not taking decisions but just discovering

### 4.2 Workshop Constraints
Consider what could go wrong in achieving your workshop goal and how you might address these issues. Think about potential backup participants you might be able to invite on short notice. Ensure having more than one person with dedicated knowledge from each team or stakeholder group. Identify subgoals that could still provide value and consider how to stretch deadlines if necessary.

**Why it matters:**  
It's important to take a moment for a more cautious perspective to prepare for potential challenges. By anticipating obstacles, you can develop contingency plans, ensuring the workshop remains productive and valuable even if not everything goes as planned. This approach fosters resilience and adaptability.

**Example:**
- Important people not showing up
- Hard deadlines that need to be met
- No backing from the management
- Decisions cannot be made
- Crucial knowledge is lacking / missing

### 4.3 High Level Agenda    
Outline the workshop structure, including methods used, expected timings, breaks, and start/end times. Provide a high-level schedule or timeline, and consider incorporating subgoals. Also decide how much information to share in advance, as it can influence engagement and the overall success of the workshop.

**Why it matters:**  
Providing participants with a clear understanding of what to expect enables them to prepare effectively and manage surrounding commitments, such as conflicting meetings, workloads, and personal obligations. While detailing every method isn't necessary, sharing the overall storyline and explaining the rationale behind chosen methods fosters trust and confidence in you as the facilitator, showcasing your well-thought-out plan. Additionally, this helps identify other organizational needs, such as food, coffee, room setup and meeting points.

**Example:**

**9:00 – 9:30** Check-In & Intro 
**9:30 – 10:30** EventStorming  
**10:30 – 10:45** Coffee Break (there is a coffee machine on the second floor)
**10:45 – 12:00** Identifying bottlenecks & potential improvements  
**12:00 – 12:30** Discussion of next steps and wrap-up
**12:30 - 13:30** Lunch together (Max will reserve a table at a nearby restaurant)

### 4.4 Participants
To effectively plan the workshop, you'll need a clear list of participants. Include not only those seeking solutions but also individuals with specialized knowledge or expertise. Consider potential questions and identify who can provide answers. Ensure you have decision-makers available if needed. Sharing knowledge is crucial, so consider having more than one representative from each stakeholder group to spread information effectively.

**Why it matters:**  
Knowing whom to invite is essential because it ensures that the workshop is productive and effective. The right participants bring the necessary expertise and perspectives, enabling comprehensive discussions and informed decision-making. It also helps balance the group with both questioners and experts, preventing the facilitator from becoming the sole source of inquiry. This strategic selection enhances collaboration, ensures all relevant issues are addressed, and maximizes the workshop's impact by involving those who can drive outcomes and implement changes.

**Example:**
- Jessica (Senior Warehouse Manager)  
- Dan (New IT Project Lead)  
- Peter, Sandra, Alex & Laura (Dev Team)
- Mario (Shipping Specialist, been here for the last 15 years)
- Rhea (Business Analyst, joined only a couple of months ago)
- Two people form the financial department (they will figure out who will join within the team)

### 4.5 Collaborative Modelling Methods
Identify which collaborative modeling methods you plan to use. Consider how these methods will impact the agenda and the room setup. Determine if there are any resources or materials that should be shared with participants in advance to enhance preparation and engagement.

**Why it matters:**  
The choice of modeling methods directly influences the workshop's structure and effectiveness. Different methods may require specific room layouts, tools, or materials, impacting logistics and planning. Sharing resources beforehand ensures participants are well-prepared, facilitating a smoother and more productive session. Additionally, the right methods foster engagement and collaboration, leading to more meaningful outcomes.

**Example:**
- EventStorming – Room with a long wall and many sticky notes
- Domain Storytelling & Wardley Mapping – Whiteboard and big screen
- User Story Mapping – Sticky notes and printed screen designs
- Impact Mapping – Flip charts/whiteboard, sticky notes, and markers
- Context Mapping in small groups – Round tables, flip charts, and sticky notes

### 4.6 Room Setup / Tools Needed
Identify the tools and equipment required for the workshop and determine who will provide what. Think about wheather you are able / need prepare the room in advance (if onsite) and when this is possible. Consider the room setup like seeting, needed walls, flipcharts, stickies, layout needed to accommodate collaborative activities and ensure all necessary materials are available.

**Why it matters:**  
Proper room setup and the availability of tools are crucial for a seamless workshop experience. The right environment enhances participant engagement, supports the chosen collaborative methods, and minimizes disruptions. Being well-prepared ensures that the workshop runs smoothly and that participants can focus on the content rather than logistical issues.

**Example:**
- Arrange seating in clusters for small group discussions.
- Ensure a projector and screen are set up for presentations.
- Provide sticky notes, markers, and flip charts for brainstorming sessions.
- Confirm Wi-Fi access for participants.

## 5\. Personal Preparation - People [WIP]

### 5.1 Princial, Initiator & Beneficiaries
**Principal** is the person or group who authorizes and funds the workshop. Their approval and support are essential for the workshop’s success.
**Initiator** is the person or group who first brought up the idea or identified the need for the workshop. They're the ones who got the ball rolling.
**Beneficiaries** refers to the group or individuals who will directly benefit from the workshop's successful outcome. They're the ones who stand to gain from the changes or improvements the workshop aims to achieve.

**Why it matters:**  
Being aware of these roles is crucial for aligning the workshop’s objectives with the broader organizational goals. Understanding who the principal, initiator, and beneficiaries are helps ensure that the workshop addresses the right needs and delivers value to the intended stakeholders.

**Example:**  
- The principal may be a senior executive who provides funding, the initiator could be a project manager driving the workshop, and the beneficiaries might be the teams who will implement the solutions discussed.

### 5.2 Participants 

#### 5.2.1 Role(s)
Identify the various roles participants hold, noting that some individuals may have multiple roles. Consider which perspectives are essential for the workshop's success.

**Why it matters:**  
Understanding the roles of your participants is crucial because each role brings unique perspectives and priorities to the workshop. Being aware of these roles helps you tailor discussions to be relevant and productive, ensuring that all viewpoints are considered. For example, a Team Lead may prioritize departmental goals, while a Software Engineer focuses on technical feasibility. Recognizing these differences allows you to anticipate potential conflicts, align objectives, and foster collaboration among diverse participants. This awareness ultimately leads to more balanced and effective outcomes.

**Example:**  
- Team Lead
- QA / Tester
- Architect
- Sales Manager
- Key Accountant
- Software Engineer
- Product Owner

#### 5.2.2 Individual Goals / Benefits / Motivations
Recognize personal or departmental goals that could influence the workshop. Determine what benefits participants hope to gain. Understand individual motivations that drive participation.

**Why it matters:**  
Knowing individual goals helps tailor the workshop to meet participants' needs, increasing engagement and satisfaction.

**Example:**  
- A participant might be motivated by career advancement opportunities through successful project outcomes.

#### 5.2.3 (Potential) Fears
Identify known or assumed fears of individuals and/or whole teams. Consider what concerns may arise that could impact participation.

**Why it matters:**  
Addressing fears can prevent resistance and foster a more open and collaborative environment.

**Example:**  
- Team members might fear that automation could lead to job losses.

#### 5.2.4 (Potential) Hidden Agendas / Politics
Be aware of any hidden motivations that could affect the workshop. Understand the political landscape and how it may influence discussions.

**Why it matters:**  
Recognizing hidden agendas helps in managing discussions constructively and ensuring balanced outcomes.

**Example:**  
- A manager might subtly promote ideas that reinforce their influence within the organization.

### 5.3 Communication Strategy
A comprehensive communication strategy is crucial for workshop success. It involves planning how you, as the facilitator, will engage with participants and stakeholders at every stage—before, during, and after the workshop. Determine when, who, and what you will communicate. Establish timelines for updates and clarify the roles of participants and stakeholders. Decide on the most effective methods for communication, such as email for detailed information, Slack for real-time interactions, and in-person meetings for more nuanced discussions.

**Why it matters:**  
Effective communication keeps everyone aligned, manages expectations, and ensures no one feels left out. It's essential to engage participants and motivate them for the workshop. In some cases, higher management may require prior check-ins to feel comfortable and well informed.

**Example:**
- Pre-workshop questionnaire via email.  
- Slack channel for real-time Q\&A.  
- Post-workshop summary circulated to all participants and sponsors.  
- Setting the stage sessions with all participants before the workshop

## 6\. Personal Preparation - Methods [WIP]

### 6.1 Advantages of Used Methods for Context, Scope, and Goals

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Why you chose EventStorming, Domain Storytelling, or other modeling methods.  
  - Specific strengths of each method that help achieve the goals.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Helps you be clear on why these methods fit well, and how to leverage their strong points. The clearer you are on your storyline the easier it is to follow for the participants. 

**Example:**

- **EventStorming**: Great for quickly visualizing an end-to-end process, identifying bottlenecks, and engaging non-technical people.  
- **Domain Storytelling**: Excellent for clarifying roles and interactions in complex processes.



### 6.2 Potential Blindspots, Risks, and Disadvantages of Used Methods

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Known issues or limitations in your chosen methods.  
  - Possible pitfalls (e.g., groupthink, time constraints) to watch out for.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Allows facilitators to anticipate problems and prepare mitigations. Being aware of there makes it easier to try out different methods and to adapt the workshop on the spot as not everything can be anticipated. 

**Example:**

- EventStorming can become chaotic if too many participants talk at once.  
- Domain Storytelling can be time-intensive if the domain is very large.



### 6.3 Strategy / Approach for Addressing Blindspots and Disadvantages

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Your plan to handle or minimize the limitations identified above.  
  - Concrete steps or facilitation techniques to keep the workshop on track.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Equips you with a “backup plan” so you can confidently guide discussions.

**Example:**

- Pre-divide the domain into manageable slices to avoid “analysis paralysis.”  
- Assign a co-facilitator to manage group discussions, keep to time boxes, and make sure all voices are heard.



## 7\. How to use this canvas

### 7.1 Preparing a CoMo workshop 
...iterate iterate iterate…

#### Before the workshop

- Try to fill out as much as you can during/after each meeting you have with the stakeholders (green & pink).   
- Make your assumptions tangible  
- Identify open questions  
- Try to gain more insights based on your assumptions and open questions.   
- Adapt the communication strategy and agenda along the way. Think about adding the sharing of the green sections to your communication strategy. 

#### After the workshop 

You can use the canvas together with the outcomes of the workshop to plan further follow ups and to reflect on your own preparation (e.g. shared goal, communication strategy, storyline, understanding your stakeholders and their hidden agendas, …). 

### 7.2 Insights for challenging environments
The canvases can also be used to identify potential triggers and patterns that may reveal a challenging environment, which might not be immediately apparent or may initially seem straightforward. Here are some of those indocators:

- **Difficulty Defining the "Purpose of Workshop" or "Outcomes":** If stakeholders struggle to articulate clear goals or success criteria, it may indicate conflicting priorities or a lack of shared understanding.  
- **Extensive "Hidden Agendas / Politics" Entries:** A long list in this section suggests a highly politicized environment with potential conflicts or resistance.  
- **Many different individual goals:** If you have many parties with very different or even contradicting (at first sight) sub-goals you should invest enough time in scoping sessions to find the overarching goal to create a win-win situation.   
- **Hard to find a goal that unites all interests:** If you cannot agree on a (even very high level) goal that unites all stakeholders, try to understand what's behind the different interests, which fears might be under the hood. (Either as part of the preparation e.g. in setting the stage sessions and scoping calls, during pre-workshops or as part of the actual workshop)   
- **Disagreement on "Scope":** If defining what is in or out of scope leads to significant debate or disagreement, it may signal differing expectations or underlying power struggles.  
- **Unclear "Principal / Client / Contracting Authority" or "Initiator":** Ambiguity about who is ultimately responsible or driving the workshop can lead to confusion and challenges. It should be clear before the workshop who is able to decide what / how decisions are made. If this is not possible / unknown, have it as part of the workshop to find it out.   
- **Complex "Participants with Questions" or "Participants with Answers":** A diverse group e.g. extroverts vs introverts or highly varied knowledge levels may require more tailored facilitation techniques.  
- **Only people with questions / only people with answers:** If you realise you only have people from one side in the canvas, you should be clear about its effects. Only people with questions will lead to many assumptions without any chance for clarification during the workshop. Only people with answers, but no-one to ask will make you a bottle neck as facilitator. Sometimes the people with the answers and people with questions can be the same, but with different hidden agendas and/or fears.  
- **Vague or Contradictory "Context of Workshop":** If stakeholders provide conflicting accounts of the current situation, it may indicate a lack of transparency or underlying issues.



### 7.3 Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple:**  
  Do not overload the canvas with text. Aim for clarity and brevity in each box. Depending on the workshop you might not need to fill all the boxes.  
    
- **Use Bullets & Visuals:**  
  Where possible, use bullet points, symbols, or short statements to keep the canvas easy to scan.  
    
- **Iterate as Needed:**  
  This canvas might evolve during preparation. Revisit each section as you learn new information.  
    
- **Leverage Co-Facilitators:**  
  Involving a co-facilitator or a small preparation team can help fill the pink sections objectively and thoroughly.  
    
- **Adapt to Your Context:**  
  Each workshop is different; customize or rename sections if it suits your organization’s language and culture better.



# Conclusion

The **Collaborative Modelling Workshop Preparation Canvas** is designed to ensure a thorough, well-managed, and transparent preparation process. By distinguishing **public** (green) areas that keep everyone aligned from **private** (pink) sections that allow facilitators to strategize on sensitive matters, you can run effective collaborative modelling sessions that engage the right people, focus on the right problems, and yield meaningful outcomes. Use the above documentation and examples as your guide, adapting them to your specific workshop context.
