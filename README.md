# Collaborative Modeling Workshop Preparation Canvases
The “Collaborative Modeling Workshop Preparation Canvases” are designed to support facilitators when preparing for collaborative modelling (CoMo) workshops. The goal is to improve the overall quality and outcomes of CoMo workshop and to help newcomers to get started.

The canvases are structured into two areas:
* Drafting the workshop (Scoping, Planning & Design)
* Personal preparation (People, Methods)

![Collaborative Modeling Workshop Preparation Canvases](resources/como-prep-canvas-v2.jpg)

> *NOTE* This is a work in progress. Currently, we've provided the canvas as an image that you can copy and paste into your preferred tool.

> We plan to create an official template on Miro in the future. Additionally, you'll be able to extend the canvas yourself in tools like Notion. If you do so, we'd love to see your contributions! Please remember to give credit, as the canvas is licensed under [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## 1\. Who are the canvases for?

The canvases are designed to support everyone facilitating collaborative modelling workshops. However it might provide different value depending on your experience and the the type of workshop:

**Guidance for New Facilitators:** The canvases offer a structured starting point, helping new facilitators understand how to plan and execute a successful workshop. They outline essential considerations when drafting a workshop and help to avoid common pitfalls.

**Tool for Experienced Facilitators:** Seasoned facilitators can use the canvases as checklists to ensure nothing is overlooked in the preparation process, maintaining high-quality standards. The structured approach also promotes a less biased preparation as one is less influenced by recent experiences and can engage with each workshop anew.

Furthermore, they can be used for the following:

**Exploring New Perspectives:** By highlighting potential different aspects, the canvases encourage facilitators to explore new perspectives and reflect on their own facilitation style. It can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify potentially challenging workshop environments and find blind spots in deceptively easy settings. Certain patterns or triggers during the canvas completion process may indicate complexity or difficulties.

**Preparing for Challenging Environments:**
The canvas is designed to help you when facing rather challenging settings. It will guide you through in your preparation and help you to better understand the environment (goal, status quo & people). It will also support you to make your own assumptions transparent to be able to challenge them. By going through the different sections and related questions, the canvas helps you to effectively prepare the workshop’s outline (storyline, communication strategy, shared goal).

## 2\. Overall Structure

### 2.1 Drafting the Workshop
These canvases are designed to guide you in drafting a workshop, whether it's with your team, facilitating it for colleagues within your company, or for clients if you're a consultant. The information you gather using these canvases should first be discussed with the initiator(s). This discussion should then lead to an invitation of the session where all relevant information is shared with all stakeholders, helping to shape the workshop's goals and structure. The canvases include guiding questions for scoping, planning, and designing a CoMo workshop.

#### [2.1.1 Scoping](#3-scoping)
![Scoping Canvas](resources/scoping.jpg)
#### [2.1.2 Workshop Planning & Design](#4-workshop-planning--design)
![Workshop Planning & Design](resources/workshop-planning-and-design.jpg)

### 2.2 Personal Preparation (**Work in Progress**)
These Canvases serve for your own preparation and should stay **with the facilitators (and their close collaborators) only** as they contain hidden agendas, assumptions, personal triggers, alternatives on methods, thoughts behind the storyline, and more. They target the rather invisible aspects that are crucial for a successful workshop preparation are split into **People** and **Methods**. The people canvas is designed to create awareness on motivations and hidden agendas of your stakeholders and how knowledge and power are distributed. The methods canvas contains different sections that help in designing a consistent storyline throught the workshop and to deep dive on the methods used.

## 3\. Drafting the Workshop - Scoping

Usually the first step when preparing a (collaborative modelling) workshop is discussing its motivation and backgroud (like *what led to the workshop*) as well as the definition of success (like *what should have changed afterwards*). Additionally, it's important to establish a suitable (working) title early on, discuss initial ideas for the workshop format, and identify the key parties involved (initiator, beneficiaries & potential participants).

### 3.1 Title of Workshop
A clear, concise name for the upcoming collaborative modeling session. 
    
**Why it matters:**  
This title sets expectations and gives the workshop a clear identity from the outset and should be aligned with the goal and scope of the workshop. If you struggle in finding a concise title for the workshop, the goal and scope might not be clear enough yet. Same applies if the title is not understood by stakeholders without further explanation. 

**Examples:**
- “EventStorming Workshop: Improving the Order Fulfillment Process”
- "Re-Discovery Workshop for the Booking Platform"
- "Domain modelling to realign teams"
- "Aligning architecture with a Bytesized Architecture session"

### 3.2 Motivation
This section delves into the "why" behind the workshop. Consider answering the following questions to clarify its purpose:
- What prompted this workshop? What specific situation or challenge led to its initiation?
- What's the current situation or status quo? Describe the existing conditions, systems, or processes.
- How are we/they organized? Outline the team structure, departmental setup, or relevant organizational aspects.
- What does the current architecture look like? Provide an overview of the existing technical or operational architecture.
- What's the current level of DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and CoMo knowledge within the team/organization?
- What specific problems are we trying to solve or opportunities are we trying to capture?

**Why it matters:**  
  It is important that you are clear about the problem you want to solve and the situation your in. Try not to solve too many problems at the same time and pinpoint the challenge you want to tackle in this workshop. The more you know in advance the better you can adapt the workshop format to the needs of the Initiator & beneficiaries. 
  
  What's more, getting stakeholders involved in these initial chats can sometimes be super valuable. If you can organise some interviews with some of the stakeholders defined after the initial scoping to improve the motivation. It helps them grasp the problem more fully and deepen their understanding, which is already a huge step toward finding a solution or making things better.
  
**Examples:**
  - To identify process bottlenecks in our current order-to-delivery workflow and collaboratively propose improvements. 
  - Currently, our average delivery time has increased from 2 days to 5 days in the last quarter.  
  - Customer complaints have risen by 40%.  
  - Multiple departments (Sales, Warehouse, Shipping) have overlapping responsibilities but lack clear communication.

### 3.3 Definition of Success
Think about what the workshop should achieve—what needs to change or improve. What are the core goals that absolutely must be met by the end of the session? Make sure to frame these as a win-win opportunity for everyone involved. You can also include some objectives that would be great to hit but aren't strictly mandatory.

**Why it matters:**  
  A definition of success for a workshop is crucial because it clarifies the objectives, outlining what the workshop aims to achieve. It guides the planning process, helping to design the format and activities to meet specific goals. It also provides a way to measure progress and evaluate the workshop's effectiveness. Ultimately, having a clear definition of success enhances focus, keeping discussions and activities centered on achieving the desired results.
  
  Additionally, it aligns participants by ensuring everyone understands the purpose and expected outcomes, providing a baseline so all enter the workshop on the same page. This should be shared beforehand and at the start of the workshop. Being aware of participants' potential fears and motivations is also beneficial([5.3 Individual goals, benefits and motivation, (Potential) fears, hidden agendas & politics](#53-individual-goals-benefits-and-motivation-potential-fears-hidden-agendas--politics)).

**Examples:**
- A shared understanding of the “Order Fulfillment” domain and key events and a clear way forward.  
- A prioritized list of bottlenecks and possible interventions.  
- Agreement on next steps to pilot one key improvement.
- A shared understanding between the different departments and everyone pulling in the same direction.

### 3.4 Workshop Format: Initial Ideas
At this stage, there's no need for a concrete agenda. However, it's helpful to start shaping the rough outline of your workshop's format. Think about key elements like the rough time frame, whether that's 1-2 hours, a half-day, or multiple days (1, 2, or even 5 days). You should also consider your initial ideas for methods you might use, such as EventStorming, Domain Storytelling, Context Mapping, User Story Mapping, or Example Mapping.

**Why it matters:**  
  Discussing initial ideas on the workshop format early on is important because it shapes the planning process, ensuring the workshop is structured effectively from the start. It aligns expectations among stakeholders, providing a shared understanding of how the workshop will proceed. It helps to identify the necessary resources and to anticipate and address potential challenges.

**Examples:**
- 1-2 hours of Design Level EventStormiung
- 1/2 day with Domain Storytelling and Example Mapping
- 5 days with Wardley Mapping, Big Picture EventStorming, Impact Mapping and Bytesized Architecture sessions.

### 3.5 Initiator & Beneficiaries
Initiator is the person or group who first brought up the idea or identified the need for the workshop. They're the ones who got the ball rolling. Beneficiaries refers to the group or individuals who will directly benefit from the workshop's successful outcome. They're the ones who stand to gain from the changes or improvements the workshop aims to achieve.    
**Why it matters:**  
  Understanding who brought the workshop to life helps clarify motivations and possible goals. They often provide valuable background information to the status quo and the people involved. They are your lever into the company / department / team, but they might also have their hidden agenda in doing so. Also be clear about who are your beneficiaries, like who actually benefits in the end of the workshop and it's results. Try to find out as much as possible about the beneficiaries throughout the preparation, e.g. fears and individual motivations. But also be aware they might be wrong / it's just one opinion. You can use the Setting the Stage sessions to get more insights yourself.

**Examples:**

- Initiator: Head of Supply Chain Innovation at XYZ Company & Beneficiaries: Operations and Sales Teams
- Initiator: Senior Dev in Team XYZ Beneficiaries: Dev & Product Teams

### 3.6 Potential Participants 
Everyone who might be needed for the workshop (e.g. Tech Leads, Developers, Tester, Sales Department, Product Owner, User, Customer, Operations, ...).
    
**Why it matters:**  
  Thinking through who should be in the room for a collaborative modeling session is absolutely essential. Every person, from Developers to Testers, and from Product Owners, Users to Domain Experts, and especially people who can decide brings a unique and vital perspective. Including these diverse viewpoints isn't just about ticking boxes; it's about building a holistic and accurate understanding of the problem or system you're modeling. When everyone contributes, you not only uncover hidden insights and potential pitfalls early but also foster a shared understanding and stronger buy-in, ultimately leading to more robust solutions and successful outcomes.

**Examples:**
- Software developers
- Testers
- Product Managers
- User researchers
- Business Analists
- Agile Coaches
- Managers
- Users
- Ops Engineers
- .. and all the roles involved and invented in your company in building the software

## 4\. Drafting the Workshop - Workshop Planning & Design

Here the sections from the Scoping Canvas can be further refined. Aditionally there is more information that should be considered which are part of the Workshop Planning & Design Canvas as well as optional sections that can be added depending on the format, context and experience of the facilitator(s).

### 4.1 Scope of the Workshop

**What to include:**
- Which services / teams / user flows / domains are we (not) looking at?
- Are there decisions to be made?
- What should be the flight level?


**Why it matters:**  
  Helps set boundaries so that discussions remain productive and relevant. Helps to set expectations and to understand the problem better. It should also help your to know who should be invited. Beeing aware of what is rather out of scope helps to keep the workshop focuesd and ensures that participants do not derail the workshop with irrelevant concerns. Sometimes it is easier to pinpoint what is rather out of scope then in scope. By asking for both you can more easily adapt to your stakeholder group and open up new perspectives. 
  
  It also helps to find the right methods for the workshop and to manage expectations (e.g. what is possible vs. what would be wished for in an ideal world). Helps facilitators prioritise if time is limited. If time remains, you can address these. Sometimes it's easier for stakeholders to deprioritise their expectations rather than skipping them completely. They can also serve as potential follow ups after the workshop.

**Example:**
- Order submission (Sales)  
- Inventory checks (Warehouse)  
- Shipping & Tracking (Logistics)
- Payment processing (handled separately by Finance)  
- Customer support ticketing (handled by Customer Service after delivery)



### 4.2 Workshop Constraints

**What to include:**  
- ...


**Why it matters:**  
  [tbd]

**Example:**
- ...

### 4.3 High Level Agenda

**What to include:**      
- The structure of the workshop: methods used, timings, breaks, and start/end times.  
- High-level schedule or timeline.


**Why it matters:**  
  Ensures participants know how the workshop will flow and when each activity will happen. The more the participants know the better they can prepare and it helps you to set expectations. There is no need to explain every method on detail but to share the overall storyline through the workshop. Explain the “why” of each method. It also increases trust and confidence in you as facilitator as you show that you have a plan.

**Example:**

1. **9:00 – 9:15** Introduction & objectives  
2. **9:15 – 10:30** EventStorming: mapping order events  
3. **10:30 – 10:45** Break  
4. **10:45 – 12:00** Identifying bottlenecks & potential improvements  
5. **12:00 – 12:30** Discussion of next steps and wrap-up

### 4.4 Participants

**What to include:**  
- Participants with knowledge gaps seeking for answers.
- Participants having deep knowledge or specialized expertise.  
- Pinpoint who can clarify certain domain aspects if questions arise.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Helps facilitators plan how to clarify concepts and provide background during the workshop. If you only have people with answers, you don't have anyone to ask them and you as facilitator might be the only one asking questions which can be quite a bottleneck. Sometimes the people with the answers are the same as the ones with the questions (curious for the other departments) but this is not always the case to better be prepared. Allows the facilitator to strategically engage the right people at the right time. If you don't include people with answers you end up with only assumptions.

**Example:**

- Jessica (New Warehouse Manager) might need basic Domain Storytelling guidance.  
- Dan (IT Project Lead) may ask about integration with legacy systems.  
- Dev Team wanting to know more about the business side.
- Mario (Shipping Specialist) knows exact shipping procedures.  
- Rhea (Business Analyst) is aware of existing metrics and performance data.  
- Financial department working with the legacy software on a day to day basis.

### 4.5 Collaborative Modelling Methods
Which collaborative modelling methods are you using? How do they impact the agenda and room setup? Are there any resources you might want to share in advance? ... 

**Why it matters:**  
  [tbd]

**Example:**
- ...

### 4.6 Room Setup / Tools Needed
What do you need? Who will provide what? When can you prep the room? ...

**Why it matters:**

**Example:**
- ...

## 5\. Personal Preparation - People [WIP]

### 5.3 Individual goals, benefits and motivation, (Potential) fears, hidden agendas & politics

**What to include:**
- Any potential personal or departmental interests that could shape the workshop’s discussions.  
- Known conflicts between individuals or teams.  
- Known or assumed fears of individuals and/or whole teams.  
- Known or potential team/power dynamics or implicit rules.

**Why it matters:**  
  Being aware of hidden motivations can help you design facilitation techniques that keep the workshop constructive. It also helps you in finding a suitable goal everyone agrees on (win-win situation) and to better navigate group dynamics by understanding their reasoning. 

**Example:**

- The Warehouse team might want to invest in automation; the Logistics team might prefer more manual checks for accuracy.  
- A manager who is resistant to change may try to block new ideas.


### 5.4 Decision makers / People with power

**What to include:**   
- Key decision-makers for any proposed outcomes or next steps.  
- Formal Leaders with official titles or authority (e.g., managers, department heads).   
- Informal Leaders who may not hold official titles but have significant influence or respect within the group.  
      
**Why it matters:**  
  Knowing who has the authority to approve or implement changes will help you manage expectations and ensure that the workshop leads to actionable results. The support and alignment of formal leadership roles are crucial for the success of the workshop as they can interfere unexpectedly. Identifying and engaging with informal leaders can also be essential as their opinion and motivation often highly influences the group dynamics.

**Example:**
- CFO, since proposed improvements might require budget.  
- HR Department, if staffing changes might result from process improvements.  
- Most senior colleagues in the team.

### 5.5 Other Stakeholders

**What to include:**   
- Individuals or groups not directly in the workshop but potentially affected by the outcomes.  
- Any high-level sponsors or department heads who might influence or be influenced by the results.


**Why it matters:**  
  Helps the facilitator consider who to inform or loop in later and plan communication accordingly. Make sure you don't have any people in the workshop which just want to watch. Try to find a task for them as well or offer to inform then afterwards about the results. They often highly influence the group dynamics. 

**Example:**
- CFO, since proposed improvements might require budget.  
- HR Department, if staffing changes might result from process improvements.



### 5.6 Communication Strategy

**What to include:**      
- How you (the facilitator) plan to communicate with participants and stakeholders before, during, and after the workshop. (when, who, what)  
- Which channels (email, Slack, in-person, etc.) will be used.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Proper communication keeps everyone aligned and manages expectations. Depending on the environment it is required to get everyone on board at the same time so no-one feels left out. Sometimes higher management positions refer a prior check in. Make sure you have the participants on your side and motivated for the workshop. 


**Example:**
- Pre-workshop questionnaire via email.  
- Slack channel for real-time Q\&A.  
- Post-workshop summary circulated to all participants and sponsors.  
- Setting the stage sessions with all participants before the workshop



## 6\. Personal Preparation - Methods [WIP]

### 6.1 Advantages of Used Methods for Context, Scope, and Goals

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Why you chose EventStorming, Domain Storytelling, or other modeling methods.  
  - Specific strengths of each method that help achieve the goals.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Helps you be clear on why these methods fit well, and how to leverage their strong points. The clearer you are on your storyline the easier it is to follow for the participants. 

**Example:**

- **EventStorming**: Great for quickly visualizing an end-to-end process, identifying bottlenecks, and engaging non-technical people.  
- **Domain Storytelling**: Excellent for clarifying roles and interactions in complex processes.



### 6.2 Potential Blindspots, Risks, and Disadvantages of Used Methods

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Known issues or limitations in your chosen methods.  
  - Possible pitfalls (e.g., groupthink, time constraints) to watch out for.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Allows facilitators to anticipate problems and prepare mitigations. Being aware of there makes it easier to try out different methods and to adapt the workshop on the spot as not everything can be anticipated. 

**Example:**

- EventStorming can become chaotic if too many participants talk at once.  
- Domain Storytelling can be time-intensive if the domain is very large.



### 6.3 Strategy / Approach for Addressing Blindspots and Disadvantages

- **What to include:**  
    
  - Your plan to handle or minimize the limitations identified above.  
  - Concrete steps or facilitation techniques to keep the workshop on track.


- **Why it matters:**  
  Equips you with a “backup plan” so you can confidently guide discussions.

**Example:**

- Pre-divide the domain into manageable slices to avoid “analysis paralysis.”  
- Assign a co-facilitator to manage group discussions, keep to time boxes, and make sure all voices are heard.



## 7\. How to use this canvas

### 7.1 Preparing a CoMo workshop 
...iterate iterate iterate…

#### Before the workshop

- Try to fill out as much as you can during/after each meeting you have with the stakeholders (green & pink).   
- Make your assumptions tangible  
- Identify open questions  
- Try to gain more insights based on your assumptions and open questions.   
- Adapt the communication strategy and agenda along the way. Think about adding the sharing of the green sections to your communication strategy. 

#### After the workshop 

You can use the canvas together with the outcomes of the workshop to plan further follow ups and to reflect on your own preparation (e.g. shared goal, communication strategy, storyline, understanding your stakeholders and their hidden agendas, …). 

### 7.2 Insights for challenging environments
The canvases can also be used to identify potential triggers and patterns that may reveal a challenging environment, which might not be immediately apparent or may initially seem straightforward. Here are some of those indocators:

- **Difficulty Defining the "Purpose of Workshop" or "Outcomes":** If stakeholders struggle to articulate clear goals or success criteria, it may indicate conflicting priorities or a lack of shared understanding.  
- **Extensive "Hidden Agendas / Politics" Entries:** A long list in this section suggests a highly politicized environment with potential conflicts or resistance.  
- **Many different individual goals:** If you have many parties with very different or even contradicting (at first sight) sub-goals you should invest enough time in scoping sessions to find the overarching goal to create a win-win situation.   
- **Hard to find a goal that unites all interests:** If you cannot agree on a (even very high level) goal that unites all stakeholders, try to understand what's behind the different interests, which fears might be under the hood. (Either as part of the preparation e.g. in setting the stage sessions and scoping calls, during pre-workshops or as part of the actual workshop)   
- **Disagreement on "Scope":** If defining what is in or out of scope leads to significant debate or disagreement, it may signal differing expectations or underlying power struggles.  
- **Unclear "Principal / Client / Contracting Authority" or "Initiator":** Ambiguity about who is ultimately responsible or driving the workshop can lead to confusion and challenges. It should be clear before the workshop who is able to decide what / how decisions are made. If this is not possible / unknown, have it as part of the workshop to find it out.   
- **Complex "Participants with Questions" or "Participants with Answers":** A diverse group e.g. extroverts vs introverts or highly varied knowledge levels may require more tailored facilitation techniques.  
- **Only people with questions / only people with answers:** If you realise you only have people from one side in the canvas, you should be clear about its effects. Only people with questions will lead to many assumptions without any chance for clarification during the workshop. Only people with answers, but no-one to ask will make you a bottle neck as facilitator. Sometimes the people with the answers and people with questions can be the same, but with different hidden agendas and/or fears.  
- **Vague or Contradictory "Context of Workshop":** If stakeholders provide conflicting accounts of the current situation, it may indicate a lack of transparency or underlying issues.



### 7.3 Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple:**  
  Do not overload the canvas with text. Aim for clarity and brevity in each box. Depending on the workshop you might not need to fill all the boxes.  
    
- **Use Bullets & Visuals:**  
  Where possible, use bullet points, symbols, or short statements to keep the canvas easy to scan.  
    
- **Iterate as Needed:**  
  This canvas might evolve during preparation. Revisit each section as you learn new information.  
    
- **Leverage Co-Facilitators:**  
  Involving a co-facilitator or a small preparation team can help fill the pink sections objectively and thoroughly.  
    
- **Adapt to Your Context:**  
  Each workshop is different; customize or rename sections if it suits your organization’s language and culture better.



# Conclusion

The **Collaborative Modelling Workshop Preparation Canvas** is designed to ensure a thorough, well-managed, and transparent preparation process. By distinguishing **public** (green) areas that keep everyone aligned from **private** (pink) sections that allow facilitators to strategize on sensitive matters, you can run effective collaborative modelling sessions that engage the right people, focus on the right problems, and yield meaningful outcomes. Use the above documentation and examples as your guide, adapting them to your specific workshop context.
